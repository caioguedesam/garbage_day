A short game where you control a garbage collector robot and collect trash for a nearby building.

You can download and play the game [here](https://caioguedes.itch.io/garbage-day)!

This game was done in my free time over the course of 2 weeks on a personal project, you can read more about it [here](https://caioguedes.itch.io/garbage-day/devlog/258476/biweekly-games-game-1-postmortem).

This was made in the Unity game engine and using Blender for light 3d modeling.
